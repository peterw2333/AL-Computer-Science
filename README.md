This repository is still under construction. New information may be added at any time, and plenty of errors are still expected to present in the notes. Final version of the notes will be uploaded at the end of May.
## How to use the notes
GitHub offers excellent online reading of Markdown files, so the notes can be directly readed online. However, the notes contains few LaTeX mathematical expressions which is not supported by GitHub. For optimal reading experience, please use **Typora**, an open-source, multi-platform Markdown editor.
